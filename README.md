## Project Description

This project is a prototype for the possibilities that AR could provide to a beauty retailer and their mobile shopping experience. We developed an AR environment in Xcode using ARKit and imported a custom 3D model of a lipstick into the scene. The app then scans the environment using the front camera, and places a plane in the space based on feature points it detects. The user then has the ability to interact with the lipstick by changing its color, rotating, and moving it. 
Technologyâ€™s role in beauty is getting bigger, and innovation is key to staying relevant. The future of beauty is headed towards heavy personalization and a modern shopping experience. Companies such as Lowes, IKEA, L'Oreal, and Sephora already have AR experiences inside of their guest applications. Consumers are constantly expecting more from their online shopping, so allowing them to experience the products in a real-world view can give them a more accurate representation of what they are buying and eliminate misleading or confusing details about a product.

## How To Run

Download or clone the repsitory and open in Xcode. Run the app on a device with AR compatability, it will not run on a simulator. The app will request access to the camera so ARKit can view the world.
