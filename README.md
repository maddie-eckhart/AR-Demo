# AR Beauty
# An AR Beauty Experience

An example of how augmented reality can impact the online shopping community, especially the beauty industry.

## Demo Mode

The main branch of this project is meant to show the realistic uses of AR in the online shopping community. Once a plane had been detected by the ARKit, 
a 3D object will be placed on the plane in a realistic size compared to its surroundings. The user will be able to manipulate the object's size, color, and orientation depending on the product shown. 
The AR portion of this app is accessed through a view controller that looks like a product display page inside a beauty retail app. To launch the app, just click the "Launch AR Experience" button.
